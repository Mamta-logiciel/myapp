				<p class="sub-heading"><b>Credit Linked Capital Subsidy (CLCS) for Technology Upgradation</b></p>
				<p> Technology upgradation would ordinarily mean induction of state-of-the-art or near state-of-heart technology. In the varying mosaic of technology covering more than 7,500 products in Indian small scale sector, technology upgradation would mean a significant step up from the present technology level to a substantially higher one involving improved productivity, and/or improvement in quality of products and/or improved environmental conditions including work environment for the unit. It includes installation of improved packaging techniques as well as anti-pollution measures and energy conservation machinery. Further, units in need of introducing facilities for in-house testing and online quality control would qualify for assistance, as the same are a case of technology up-gradation. Replacement of existing equipment/technology with same equipment/technology will not qualify for subsidy under this scheme, nor would the scheme be applicable to units upgrading with used machinery.<br>
				Nature of assistance: The revised scheme aims at facilitating technology upgradation by providing 15% upfront capital subsidy to MSEs, including tiny, khadi, village and coir industrial units, on institutional finance availed by them for induction of well-established and improved technologies in specified sub-sectors/products approved under the scheme.</p>
				<strong>Revised CLCS has been amended as follows:</strong>
				<ul class="listing-disc">
					<li>
						Ceiling on loans under the scheme has been raised from Rs.40 lakh to Rs.1 crore
					</li>
					<li>
						Rate of subsidy has been enhanced from 12% to 15%.
					</li>
					<li>
						Admissible capital subsidy is calculated with reference to purchase price of plant and Machinery, instead of term loan disbursed to the beneficiary unit.
					</li>
					<li>
						Practice of categorisation of MSEs in different slabs on the basis of their present investment for determining eligible subsidy has been done away with; and
					</li>
					<li>
						Operation of the scheme has been extended up to 31st March, 2007. The above revisions/ amendments were made effective from September 29, 2005.
